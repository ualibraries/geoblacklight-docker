      "Dataset depicts EPA Superfund sites throughout Arizona. This dataset was created from the CERLIS database.

It contains information on hazardous waste site assessment and remediation. For distribution with BASINS v.2.0, the spatial attributes of the database were prepared in Arcview shape file format while selected relational attributes were prepared in Arcview DBF file format."
