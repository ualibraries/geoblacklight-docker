This is an override of the Blacklight (BL) _user_util_links.html.erb file.

https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/blob/main/app/views/shared/_user_util_links.html.erb

Removes links associated with user accounts (removed for MVP, will be added in at a later date).
Keeps other links determined by the catalog_controller.rb file, under "Nav actions from Blacklight" (~ L298).
