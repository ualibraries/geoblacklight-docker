<%#
This is an override of the GeoBlacklight (GBL) _show_header_default.html.erb file.
Blacklight (BL) also has this file, but is overridden by GBL, so we are
overriding based on GBL > BL.

https://github.com/geoblacklight/geoblacklight/blob/main/app/views/catalog/_show_header_default.html.erb

Switches from an h2 to an h1, for proper markup ordering (h1 always comes first).
